For the licensing, I used Apache License 2.0 because it allows other people to use the code in my repository for both commercial and non-commercial use, including full rights to distribute and modify the code. However, in the license, it stated that "You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License". This means that the derivative works or modifications to my code should be licensed under the same condition as the original code and this should prevents the use of more restrictive licenses for derivative works.
